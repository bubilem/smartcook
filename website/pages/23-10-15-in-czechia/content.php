  <p>The team from Poland arrived in the evening. We were ready to welcome them at our agreed meeting point.
     After exchanging greetings, they took a moment to check in at the hotel. Later, 
     we gathered at a spot that was ideal for a relaxed yet engaging gathering. It was a chance to truly connect without any formalities, 
     and time seemed to pass quickly. Following our meeting, the Polish team had to return to the hotel for the dinner. 
     We bid farewell. Then our Czech team decided it was time to call it a day and head home. 
     It was effective beginning to what promises to be an exciting collaboration.
