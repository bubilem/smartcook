  <p>The two groups got together at the school on Wednesday. A session on database design and development was held in the morning, 
    once more under the direction of Mr. Bubílek. Since Polish students lack prior expertise in this area, 
    the course was designed to be helpful to them. Teams of Czech and Polish students collaborated on a few tasks. 
    There was a laid-back vibe to the afternoon. Everyone had a great time during Mrs. Ulrichová's photography workshop. 
    The students worked with cameras, learning how to use various equipment and how to set them up as efficiently as possible. 
    Particularly from the school premises, some amusing pictures were captured. 
    Several students participated in an escape game in the evening.
