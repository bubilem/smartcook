  <h1>We use AI</h1>
  <p>We use different AI models in practice.</p>
  <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the way students approach their work, 
    offering tools that enhance efficiency and creativity. In the realm of software development, 
    extensions for Visual Studio Code, such as Codeium, are proving invaluable. These AI-powered 
    tools assist with coding by suggesting improvements, automating repetitive tasks, and even 
    writing code snippets, which significantly speeds up the development process. Furthermore, 
    AI's impact extends beyond code; students are utilizing AI models like DALL-E to generate 
    images for various purposes. For instance, they create visual representations for demo data 
    in databases, design backgrounds for client applications, and more. This not only saves time 
    but also allows for a high degree of customization and personalization, catering to the specific 
    needs of their projects. The integration of AI into student work is a testament to the technology's 
    versatility and its potential to be a game-changer in educational environments and beyond.</p>
