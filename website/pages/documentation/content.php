  <h1>Documentation</h1>
  <p>How we created the documentation.</p>
  <p>To document a project comprehensively, one must ensure that all aspects of the project are recorded and organized systematically. 
    This includes maintaining the source code for both the API and its clients, as well as the source code for the web presentation. 
    Documentation is a crucial part of this process, typically involving detailed descriptions and instructions stored in Word 
    documents for general project documentation, and in Markdown files for API documentation. Utilizing version control systems 
    like Git is essential for tracking changes, collaborating with team members, and managing different versions of the project. 
    Hosting the repository on platforms like <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> allows for secure storage, sharing, and 
    distribution of the code and documentation, while also providing tools for issue tracking and feature requests, thereby 
    ensuring a well-documented and maintainable project.
