    <h1>June 2. 2024</h1>
    <p>On Sunday we set off early in the morning. During the journey we enjoyed many stops at different types of fast
        food. When we arrived in Ostr√≥da at the place where the Polish team leaders were waiting for us, we were tired
        and overfed. What we didn't expect was a big dinner. After the project team meeting and completely stuffed, we
        just rolled over in our beds and slept until morning. The whole week was in the spirit of food.</p>
