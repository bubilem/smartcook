          <p>
            An apple is a round, edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus
            domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most
            widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in
            Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still
            found. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and
            Europe and were introduced to North America by European colonists.
            Apples have religious and mythological significance in many
            cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.

          <p>
            Apples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their
            parents, and the resultant fruit frequently lacks desired
            characteristics. Generally, apple cultivars are propagated by clonal
            grafting onto rootstocks. Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend
            to be larger and much slower to fruit after planting. Rootstocks are
            used to control the speed of growth and the size of the resulting
            tree, allowing for easier harvesting.
